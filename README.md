# Notes
### Where ideas get a chance to grow
#### A project at hammerdirt, almost any project will get started here. The initial logic or code blocks will be developed in a notebook or a script. If it goes any further great!

#### Some folders are actual linked content:

1. notes-hammerdirt.ch
   - explains the methods used to calculate probability
   - explains how 'normal' is defined
2. micro
   - Cleaning of data from the microbio project
   - Creation of cahrts for the microbio project

If the folder is named after a python library then it is a review of how to use the library or how to apply it to a particular use case.

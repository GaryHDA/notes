# Notes
### Where ideas get a chance to grow
#### A project at hammerdirt, almost any project will get started here. The initial logic or code blocks will be developed in a notebook or a script. If it goes any further great!

#### Some folders are actual linked content:

1. notes-hammerdirt.ch
   - explains the methods used to calculate probability
   - explains how 'normal' is defined
   - anyother analysis method that would benefit from a detailed explanation
2. micro
   - Cleaning of data from the microbio project
   - Creation of charts for the microbio project

If the folder is named after a python library then it is a review of how to use the library or how to apply it to a particular use case.

The filename identifies:

1. The staff member
2. The resource or the subject

We use Anaconda to manage our environments:

1. The .yml file for this repo is included
2. Here are the instructions for creating an environment from a .yml file [go](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file)

### Do not put copyrighted material in this repository:

1. This includes texts for which we (hammerdirt) have a valid license
2. Code samples from texts that are copy righted
3. Links to copyrighted texts that have been uploaded to another server

There are plenty of resources out there. No need to steal anybodies work.

### Learning on the job 

Essential to becoming/being a developer is "Learning" and that is the principle function of this repo.

This work is my own, you can use it you want ---

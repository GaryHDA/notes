# notes
### A place to consolidate, go over basics and generally get better at what I do
#### This will get updated on an adhoc basis

Learning anything on the job is tough. So here is where I take step back get to the basics or the relevant source doucument and get a better understanding of the underlying principles.

As modules or projects progress there is always that moment of "Is that the best way to do that" or "I wonder if this would work". Usually I get to some kind of solution and move on, the note or thought gets burried in some directory the filename long forgotten.
This repository is where I go over basics like:
1. Reviewing the latest version of some programing text
2. Trying out different methods
3. Consolidating experience after the end of a project
4. Try new libraries
### Organization
General subjects are labeled by the python or js library. If the notes are for a specific project or module then the notebook name will relflect the repository.
### This work is my own
I am sharing it with you

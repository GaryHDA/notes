# Notes
### Where ideas get a chance to grow
### Learning on the job
#### A project at hammerdirt, almost any project will get started here. The intial logic or code blocks will be developed in a notebook or a script. If it goes any further great!

#### Some folders are actual linked content:

1. notes-hammerdirt.ch
   - explains the methods used to calculate probability
   - explains how 'normal' is defined
2. micro
   - Cleaning of data from the microbio project
   - Creation of cahrts for the microbio project
   

As modules or projects progress there is always that moment of "Is that the best way to do that" or "I wonder if this would work". Usually I get to some kind of solution and move on, the note or thought gets burried in some directory the filename long forgotten.
This repository is where I go over basics like:
1. Reviewing the latest version of some programing text
2. Trying out different methods
3. Consolidating experience after the end of a project
4. Try new libraries
### Organization
General subjects are labeled by the python or js library. If the notes are for a specific project or module then the notebook name will relflect the repository.
### This work is my own
I am sharing it with you

# notes
### A place to consolidate, go over basics and generally get better at what I do

As modules or projects progress there is always that moment of "Is that the best way to do that" or "I wonder if this would work". Usually I get to some kind of solution and move on, the note or thought gets burried in some directory the filename long forgotten.
This repository is where I go over basics like:
1. Reviewing the latest version of some programing text
2. Trying out different methods
3. Consolidating experience after the end of a project
4. Try new libraries
### Organization
General subjects are labeled by the python or js library. If the notes are for a specific project or module then the notebook name will relflect the repository.
### This work is my own
I am sharing it with you
